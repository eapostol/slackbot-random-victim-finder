This application was created to randomly select a student in class using a custom Slack slash command followed up with the class type. Chosen names will be removed from the database eliminating the possibilty of reselecting the same person. 

To initialize enter, `/victim reset`. This action will repopulate the database with _all_ names for _all_ cohorts. This should be done when the names have been exhausted or when the list needs to be rebuilt.

To randomly select a name enter, `/victim mw`, `/victim tth` or `/victim sat` and voil√†!

## Installation

To run locally download to your local machine and run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ nodemon index.js
```
Set up within Slack is still required (i.e. slash command, interactive message, db).

Hosting on Heroku using the free tier may result in a slight response delay while the server spins up.

<sub>Note to self: command to view the log within Heroku is `heroku logs --source app` or `heroku logs --tail` (realtime).</sub>


## Implementation

To use this within your own Slack workspace the following elements will require attention:

* Hosting. This application is hosted on Heroku using their [free tier](https://www.heroku.com/pricing). Continue using Heroku or any hosting service of your liking.
* mLab. Create a new deployement and Users then update the URI. 
* Cohort session. This app was built for two different cohorts (Monday/Wednesday & Tuesday/Thursday) that meet on Saturday in a combined session. If your schedule differs the following files will require session names (i.e. mw, tth, sat) to be updated, removed and/or added:
	* [Victim.js](./models/Victim.js). Update model names as needed. 
	* [anotherVictim.js](./options/anotherVictim.js). Update `callback_id` and exports names as needed. 
	* [mwClass.js](./options/mwClass.js). Update with the names of your students.
	* [tthClass.js](./options/tthClass.js). Update with the names of your students. If the file is to be removed or more is to be added, update the `victims.js` require statement as well.

	* [victims.js](./routes/api/victims.js). Be aware the use of 'mw', 'tth', and 'sat' and where those values should be updated. Making changes to any of the earlier mentioned files will directly affect this file.
* Slack Integration. Create a [new app](https://api.slack.com/apps) and develop it in your Slack workspace.
	* Basic Information. Fill in the App Name, Short Description and Background Color. Included in the assets folder is an [image file](./assets/crosshairs.jpeg) that can be used for the app icon. 
	* Interactive Components. Turn this on. The Request URL should point back to your server with `/api/victims/` appended to the end. 
	* Slash Commands. Create a new command using `/victim`. This can be updated to your liking. The Request URL should point back to your server but with `/api/victims/` appended to the end. Give your app a short description and any usage hint(s) (e.g. "Use `/victim mw`, `/victim tth`, `/victim sat` or `/victim reset`")
	* OAuth Tokens & Redirect URLs. Include the following Scopes: `commands`. Then click the Install App to Workspace button. No need to copy the access token.   
* Key. Be sure to update the [key](./config/keys_prod.js) accordingly with the mLab URI.
* [index.js](./index.js). Update the require path if changing the route structure.
