This application was created to randomly select a student in class using a custom Slack slash command followed with the day of class. Chosen names will be removed from the database eliminating the possibilty of reselecting the same person. 

To initialize enter, `/victim reset`. This action will reset the database with _all_ names for _all_ classes. This should be done when the names have been exhausted or when the list needs to be rebuilt.

To choose a name enter, `/victim mw`, `/victim tth` or `/victim sat` and voil√†!

## Installation

To run locally download to your local machine and run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ nodemon index.js
```
Set up within Slack is still required (i.e. slash command, interactive message, db).

Note to self: command to view the log within Heroku is `heroku logs --source app`

<sub>Hosting on Heroku using the free tier may result in a slight response delay while the server spins up.</sub>

## Implementation

To use this within your own Slack workspace the following elements will require attention:

* Hosting. This application is hosted on Heroku using their [free tier](https://www.heroku.com/pricing). Continue using Heroku or any hosting service of your liking.
* mLab. Create a new deployement and Users then update the URI. 
* Class sessions. This app was built for two different classes (Monday/Wednesday & Tuesday/Thursday) that meet on Saturday in a combined session. If your schedule differs the following files will require session names (i.e. mw, tth, sat) to be updated, removed and/or added:
	* [Victim.js](./models/Victim.js). Update model names as needed. 
	* [anotherVictim.js](./options/anotherVictim.js). Update `callback_id` and exports names as needed. 
	* [mwClass.js](./options/mwClass.js). Update with the names of your students.
	* [tthClass.js](./options/tthClass.js). Update with the names of your students. If the file is to be removed or more is to be added, update the `victims.js` require statement as well.

	* [victims.js](./routes/api/victims.js). Be aware the use of mw, tth, and sat 
* Slack Integration. Create a [new app](https://api.slack.com/apps) and develop it in your Slack workspace.
	* Basic Information. Fill in the App Name, Short Description and Background Color.
	* Interactive Components. Turn this on. The Request URL should point back to your server with `/api/custom_name/survey` appended to the end. Swap `custom_name` with a name of your liking and update the route within `server.js`.

	* Slash Commands. Create a new command using `/fist-to-five`. The Request URL should point back to your server but with `/api/custom_name` appended to the end. The custom name used here should be the same used in Interactive Components. Give your app a short description and any usage hint(s) (e.g. "Use `/fist-to-five reset` to reset app")
	* OAuth Tokens & Redirect URLs. Include the following Scopes: `channels:read`, `chat:write:bot`, `chat:write:user`, `groups:read`, `im:read`, & `mpim:read`, `commands`. Then click the Install App to Workspace button to reveal your OAuth access token.  
* Keys. Be sure to update the [keys](./config/keys_prod.js) accordingly and update the `slackTokenPath` within the routes file (i.e. slackTokenPath.*uclaSlackAccessToken*).

* `server.js`. Require your file into `server.js` and connect the route. Ignore/remove the code block inside the pink box.

* `thumb_url`. Within the routes file look for `thumb_url`. There are 3 occurences but only 1 requires updating. If you choose to include a thumbnail image with the message confirmation, update the path. Otherwise it can removed.
* Custom emojis. The the hand emojis used can be found [here](./assets/hand/).
